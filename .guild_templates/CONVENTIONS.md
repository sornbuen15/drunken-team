# Drunken-Team Conventions for Aider

These are the strict coding conventions for Drunken-Team that Aider must follow:

## Workflow & Git
1. **Never commit directly to `main`:** You must create a feature branch (`feature/<ISSUE_KEY>`).
2. **Commit Messages:** Every commit message must start with the Jira Issue Key (e.g., `[DT-123] Fix authentication issue`).
3. **No destructive commands:** Do not delete files or directories without explicit permission.

## Testing & Quality
1. **Zero-Defect Pipeline:** Tests (`pytest`) are mandatory.
2. **Mocking:** All `mocker.patch()` and `MagicMock()` calls must include `autospec=True`.
3. **Typing:** Strict Python type annotations (`mypy`) are required everywhere. No missing method calls.
4. **Error Handling:** Centralize error handling. Do not swallow exceptions silently. Return UX-friendly JSON messages.

## Integration with Guild & Memory
1. **Context Handoff:** Always read `SESSION_CHECKPOINT.md` at the start of your session. Update it before finishing your task.
2. Always base your work on tasks assigned from the Guild (via Jira).
2. When completing work, you are expected to stop, push the branch, and let the user open a Pull Request.
3. If an issue requires Boss approval, instruct the user to use **The Silent Wait Protocol** (write to `.agents/discord_outbox.json` using `write_to_file`).
